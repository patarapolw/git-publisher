After all, I am moving to Netlify, powered by [blog.nuxt](https://github.com/patarapolw/blog.nuxt), which is also for SEO purposes.

Also, Netlify is easier for a more complex setup (uses build script), just like Heroku; but [Netlify might load faster than Heroku for static pages](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/12/15/migrating-to-a-static-site-with-jamstack-netlify/).
